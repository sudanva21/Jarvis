## ⚙️ Customization Options

### Change Beep Sound:
```python
# In task_manager.py, line 228
winsound.Beep(1000, 300)  # (frequency_Hz, duration_ms)

# Examples:
winsound.Beep(2000, 500)  # Higher pitch, longer
winsound.Beep(500, 200)   # Lower pitch, shorter
winsound.Beep(1500, 400)  # Medium pitch, medium
```

### Change Number of Beeps:
```python
# In task_manager.py, line 227
for _ in range(3):  # Change 3 to any number
    winsound.Beep(1000, 300)
```

### Change Voice Speed:
```python
# In task_manager.py, line 234
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Words per minute

# Examples:
engine.setProperty('rate', 120)  # Slower
engine.setProperty('rate', 180)  # Faster
engine.setProperty('rate', 200)  # Very fast
```

### Change Voice Gender:
```python
# In task_manager.py, line 241
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')

# Male voice (usually index 0)
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)

# Female voice (usually index 1)
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
```

### Change Reminder Message:
```python
# In task_manager.py, line 244
reminder_text = f"Sir, this is a reminder. {task['text']}"

# Examples:
reminder_text = f"Attention! {task['text']}"
reminder_text = f"Hey boss! Don't forget: {task['text']}"
reminder_text = f"JARVIS here. Reminder: {task['text']}"
reminder_text = f"Time for: {task['text']}"
```

## 🎨 Advanced Customization

### Add Different Alarm Patterns:

**Pattern 1: Urgent (Fast beeps)**
```python
for _ in range(5):
    winsound.Beep(2000, 150)  # 5 fast high-pitched beeps
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

**Pattern 2: Gentle (Slow beeps)**
```python
for _ in range(2):
    winsound.Beep(800, 500)   # 2 slow low-pitched beeps
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

**Pattern 3: Escalating (Increasing pitch)**
```python
for freq in [500, 1000, 1500, 2000]:
    winsound.Beep(freq, 200)
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

### Add Priority-Based Alarms:
```python
def _play_alarm_and_speak(self, task):
    priority = task.get('priority', 'normal')
    
    if priority == 'high':
        # Urgent alarm - 5 fast beeps
        for _ in range(5):
            winsound.Beep(2000, 150)
            time.sleep(0.1)
    elif priority == 'low':
        # Gentle alarm - 1 beep
        winsound.Beep(800, 300)
    else:
        # Normal alarm - 3 beeps
        for _ in range(3):
            winsound.Beep(1000, 300)
            time.sleep(0.2)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No sound plays
**Possible causes:**
- Volume is muted
- Running on non-Windows system
- Sound drivers not working

**Solution:**
```python
# Test if winsound works
import winsound
winsound.Beep(1000, 500)  # Should hear a beep
```

### Issue 2: Voice doesn't speak
**Possible causes:**
- pyttsx3 not initialized
- No voices installed
- Audio output disabled

**Solution:**
```python
# Test pyttsx3
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("Testing")
engine.runAndWait()
```

### Issue 3: Alarm blocks other operations
**This shouldn't happen** - alarm runs in separate thread

**Check:**
```python
# In task_manager.py, line 252
thread = threading.Thread(target=alarm_thread, daemon=True)
thread.start()  # Non-blocking
```

### Issue 4: Multiple alarms overlap
**This is normal** if multiple reminders trigger at same time

**To prevent:**
```python
# Add a lock
import threading
alarm_lock = threading.Lock()

def alarm_thread():
    with alarm_lock:
        # Play alarm
        ...
```
