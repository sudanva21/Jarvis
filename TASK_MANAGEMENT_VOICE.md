## 🚀 Auto-Listening Feature

**JARVIS automatically starts listening after asking a question!**

**Example:**
```
You: "Delete task"
JARVIS: "Which task would you like to delete?"
[Microphone automatically turns on after 2 seconds]
You: "1"
[No need to click microphone!]
```

This makes the conversation completely hands-free!

## 💡 Tips

### 1. Use Numbers for Speed
```
Fast: "1"
Slower: "Call mom"
Both work, but numbers are quicker!
```

### 2. Be Specific with Names
```
Good: "Call mom"
Better: "Call mom about birthday"
```

### 3. Keep Time Simple
```
Simple: "3 PM"
Complex: "at 3 o'clock in the afternoon"
Both work, but simple is better!
```

### 4. Use "No Time" for Todos
```
You: "Create a task"
You: "Buy milk"
You: "no time"
✅ Creates a todo without schedule
```
