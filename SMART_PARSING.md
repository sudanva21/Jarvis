## 🎨 Smart Features

If only task: Ask for time

If neither: Ask for task first
```

- "remind me to"
- "remind me"
- "set a reminder to"

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Enhanced Regex Patterns:
```python
time_patterns = [
    r'at (\d{1,2}):(\d{2})\s*(am|pm)?',  # at 3:30 PM
    r'at (\d{1,2})\s*(am|pm)',            # at 3 PM
    r'(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})\s*(am|pm)',       # 3:30 PM
    r'(\d{1,2})\s*(am|pm)',               # 3 PM
    r'in (\d+)\s*(second|minute|hour|day)s?',  # in 30 minutes
    r'after (\d+)\s*(second|minute|hour|day)s?',  # after 1 hour
    r'tomorrow\s+at\s+(\d{1,2}):?(\d{2})?\s*(am|pm)?',  # tomorrow at 3 PM
    r'tomorrow',                          # tomorrow
    r'next (monday|tuesday|...)',         # next Monday
    r'(today|tonight)'                    # today/tonight
]
```

### Smart Extraction:
```python
1. Find time pattern in command
2. Extract time portion
3. Remove time from command
4. Remove trigger phrases
5. Clean whitespace
6. Capitalize first letter
