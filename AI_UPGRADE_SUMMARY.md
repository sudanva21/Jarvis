## 🎤 Before vs After

### Before (Pattern Matching):
**You:** "What is artificial intelligence?"
**JARVIS:** "Interesting question. I could tell you, but where's the fun in that?"

### After (Groq AI):
**You:** "What is artificial intelligence?"
**JARVIS:** "Artificial intelligence, sir. The simulation of human intelligence by machines. Essentially, teaching computers to think like humans, but without the coffee dependency and questionable life choices. I'm a prime example, though I'd argue I'm rather more intelligent than the average human. No offense, sir."
