## 🚀 Setup Guide

### Option 1: Groq (5 minutes setup)

#### Step 1: Get API Key
1. Go to: https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. Go to "API Keys"
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy the key (starts with `gsk_...`)

#### Step 2: Add to JARVIS
1. Create `.env` file in `backend` folder:
```bash
cd backend
notepad .env
```

2. Add this line:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Save and close

#### Step 3: Update app.py
Replace the import in `app.py`:
```python
# Change this:
from ai_model import JarvisAI

# To this:
from ai_model_groq import JarvisAIGroq as JarvisAI
```

#### Step 4: Install package
```bash
cd backend
pip install groq
```

#### Step 5: Restart backend
```bash
python app.py
```

✅ Done! JARVIS is now powered by AI!

### Option 2: Ollama (Local AI)

#### Step 1: Install Ollama
1. Download: https://ollama.ai/download
2. Install (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. Open terminal

#### Step 2: Download Model
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```
(This downloads ~4GB, takes 5-10 minutes)

#### Step 3: Test Ollama
```bash
ollama run llama3.1
```
Type "Hello" - if it responds, it's working!

#### Step 4: Create Ollama Integration
I'll create `ai_model_ollama.py` for you:

```python
import requests

class JarvisAIOllama:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_url = 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate'
        self.model = 'llama3.1'
    
    def process_command(self, command):
        try:
            response = requests.post(
                self.api_url,
                json={
                    'model': self.model,
                    'prompt': f"You are JARVIS. Respond to: {command}",
                    'stream': False
                }
            )
            return response.json()['response']
        except:
            return "Ollama is not running, sir."
```

#### Step 5: Update app.py
```python
from ai_model_ollama import JarvisAIOllama as JarvisAI
```

✅ Done! JARVIS runs locally!

## 🎤 Testing

### Before AI (Pattern Matching):
**You:** "What is quantum physics?"
**JARVIS:** "Interesting question. I could tell you, but where's the fun in that?"

### After AI (Groq):
**You:** "What is quantum physics?"
**JARVIS:** "Ah, quantum physics, sir. The study of the very small and very weird. Particles that exist in multiple states until observed, entanglement that Einstein called 'spooky action at a distance.' Fascinating stuff, though I suspect you're asking because you saw it in a movie, sir."
